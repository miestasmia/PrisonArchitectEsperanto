"Congratulations on completing your basic induction - you are now a fully "
"qualified Prison Architect!  Soon you'll be designing, building and running "
"your own prisons starting from nothing but an empty plot of land and a few "
"stacks of bricks.  Before you get started, I thought I might share some "
"important lessons with you.\n"
"\n"
"1. Every prison needs a Warden - he should be one of your first hires.  "
"Build him a nice office and he'll open up a whole range of advanced "
"facilities via the bureaucracy system.\n"
"\n"
"2. Individual jail cells are expensive, especially early on when funds are "
"very tight.  Save money by starting with a single large Holding Cell, which "
"can be shared between many prisoners at once.\n"
"\n"
"3. Get your Kitchen and Canteen up and running before the first prisoners "
"show up, and be sure to hire some Cooks - nothing irritates a prisoner more "
"than an empty stomach!\n"
"\n"
"4. Building a prison is an expensive undertaking, and you need to become a "
"master of raising large volumes of money through grants and contracts. You "
"can access these grants through the 'Reports' screens.\n"
"\n"
"That's about everything - good luck!\n"
